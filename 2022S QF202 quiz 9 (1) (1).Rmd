# Question 1

1. Please analyze the following code. Run the code to generate a sequence of length = 10000. 

```{r}
n = 1000
epsilon=rnorm(n,sd=1)
rt = epsilon[-1]-0.4*epsilon[-n]
```

Please write down in the provided space the name of the model, its formula dynamics using the numerical values of the parameters.





2. Fit the rt data to a model using the `arima()` function. Please use the order you determined in part 1 or use the appropriate diagnostic plots to find a proper order. Display the results from `tsdiag()` and state your observations.
```{r}

```

3. Output a 5-step prediction using the estimated model. You can provide either a plot or the forecast values.

```{r}

```
