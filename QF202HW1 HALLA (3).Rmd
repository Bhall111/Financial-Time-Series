Problem 1:
a. The expected return for stock A is 2.4%
   The expected return for stock B is 1.8%
   The expected return for stock C is -2.285%
   
b. The variance for stock A is .0019444
   The variance for stock B is .000336
   The variance for stock C is .227672
   
c. I would say stock A is the best option due to its overall
highest expected return while still maintaining a moderately low variance.

Problem 3: 
See Below Code
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#3 #a
sample <- rbinom(100, 9, 1/5)

#b
mean(sample)

9*(1/5)

#c
var(sample)
(9)*(1/5)*(4/5)

#d
Exp_xy <- c()

sample_size <- c()
x <- 1

for (i in seq(from = 100, to = 10000, by = 100)) {
  sample <- rbinom(i, 9, 1/5)
  sample_size[x] <- i
  Exp_xy[x] <- mean(sample)
  x = x + 1
}
plot(sample_size, Exp_xy)

abline(a = 9*(1/5), b = 0)
```
