# Question 1

Download data for stock MSFT from 2017-01-01 to 2020-01-01 and calculate the log returns using adjusted close price. Use the procedure we introduced in the class to apply ADF test on the log return sequence.

```{r}
# Get MSFT data from 2017-01-01 to 2020-01-01
getSymbols(c("MSFT"), from ="2017-01-01", to="2020-01-01")

# Calculate the log returns using adjusted close price
prices <- MSFT$MSFT.Adjusted
returns <- dailyReturn(MSFT$MSFT.Adjusted, type = "log")

# Apply ADF test on the log return sequence
adf.test(returns)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
acf(returns)
pacf(returns)
```
